I used to have the radio alphabet memorized. That was awesome!

I forgot it. Lamesauce!

I am going to write a program, to run daily (or thereabouts), that will help me memorize this:
* alpha
* bravo
* charlie
* delta
* echo
* foxtrot
* golf
* hotel
* india
* juliet
* kilo
* lima
* mike
* november
* oscar
* papa
* quebec
* romeo
* sierra
* tango
* uniform
* victor
* whisky
* x-ray
* yankee
* zulu

It will do this by shuffling up the words (so I don't memorize the pattern, but the actual words), and prompting me with the starting letter. If I get it right, that letter is done. If not, a new letter will be asked, and the incorrect one will turn up later. This will repeat until all 26 letters are done, or until I force-quit like a whiny quitter butt.
